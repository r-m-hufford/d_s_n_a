# 🧐 Data Structures and Algorithms 🤓

The purpose of this project is twofold...

1. Freshen up on core Java. I worked hard to be learn Java and I do not want to let it slip completely.

2. A little ds&a refresh never hurt anyone.

### What is going on here...

I am going to work my way through the classics. I will start with linked list, stacks, etc. After that I will build out hash maps and trees. Along the way I will build variations of data structures I have completed (i.e. circular lists, priority queues etc). I will also build out some of the more complex data structures like graphs and tries. I would like to fold some visual form of these structures into a webapp someday.
