# üßê Data Structures and Algorithms ü§ì

The purpose of this project is twofold...

1. Freshen up on Java. I worked heckin' hard to be good at Java and I do not want to let it slip completely.

2. A little ds&a refresh never hurt anyone.

### What is going on here...

On the data structures side of things, I am going to work my way through the classics. I will start with linked list, stacks, etc. After that I will build out hash maps and trees. Along the way I will build variations of data structures I have completed (i.e. circular lists, priority queues etc). Maybe someday I find myself building a Fenwick Tree or a Bloom Filter.

On the algorithms side, I will chip away at hackerrank algos. I'd like to explore/re-explore the classics here too. It has been a while since I have built a bubble sort or a binary search or something recursive. I should build Dijkstra's, breadth and depth-first searches, a quicksort. Eventually, I will figure out if p is equal to np and then we'll all have lunch.
